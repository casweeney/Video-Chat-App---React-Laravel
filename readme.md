## Video Chat App

The Video Chat App was built with Laravel for the backend and React.js for the front with some WebRT dependencies. The app is able to turn on device camera and microphone. It enables registered and signed in user to make video calls to other signed in users.

### Apparently the call feature is still an issue and it is yet to be fixed. The app can turn on device camera and mic but it is yet to make the calls. Feel free to join the project.
